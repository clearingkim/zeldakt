\title{Predicted Distance Function(4para)}
\usage{
four_pred_dist(data, startyear, endyear)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{'data' should be a data object with following variables: YEAR (the year of event), EVENT_DATE (the date of event),
ACTOR1 (focal actor name), ACTOR2 (alter actor name), LATITUDE (latitude), LONGITUDE (logitude). Note: the variable names should be EXACT.}

\item{startyear}{The first year you want to produce the predicted distance. It should be later than the earliest year of your data.}

\item{endyear}{The last year you want to produce the predicted distance. It should be earlier than the lastest year of your data.}
}
\description{
This function allows you to produce the predicted distance (4para) of moving actors in your dataset
